                    <p>The main advantage of this way to make money is minimum time required. I’m at university now, the attendance is strictly
                       monitored, so I cannot lose focus
                       from study for a long time. I’m trading on signals and everything is smooth sailing now! The income is quite good: I shouldn’t
                       stretch finances or count on
                       parents. Before I was too emotional and screwed everything up several times. I’m much better now – gained experience and
                       signals helps me a lot.</p>

                    <p>The priorities may vary depending on a trader, but trust and honesty of a broker are very important for me. I’ve been working
                       with Olymp Trade since 2014.
                       Firstly, my strategy didn’t work at all, I lost some money several times. But I’m not tend to get the jitters, so I’ve managed
                       to earn pretty well recently.
                       The broker has never had problems with withdrawals. Support just approved my identity and withdraw 105.900 rubles (1606 USD)
                       without any issues. Thanks,
                       Olymp Trade! I’ll trade with you for a long time! Wish you success!</p>

                    <p>So, my trial day shows that even a beginner could study everything out. I’ve finished Academy course and tested it on
                       demo-account. When I got it, I used
                       bonus for Academy and added some real money. So I didn’t worry when started trading, due to trainings. If you’ve decided to
                       try, my advice is to use demo
                       first. You’ll be more efficient in real trading. And no mistakes because of emotions.</p>

                    <p>Finally, I found a convenient company! I truly love the feature of fast withdrawal. Nothing compares to money coming to your
                       credit card! I rely on my own
                       trading strategy and feel calm about it. I can earn my month salary just opening 5-6 successful trades. I was trading on forex
                       previously, but when I tried
                       options, as this instrument is much more convenient and less time-consuming. I recommend it to all forex-traders, if
                       they are tired from long-term
                       trading.</p>

                a) act as a counterparty with respect to any asset;<br>
                b) suggest another partner of the Company as a counterparty for a trading operation;<br>
                c) give recommendations and render services to its partners or other clients of the Company with respect to assets they are interested in, despite the fact that this is in conflict with the Client’s interests.</p>

From time to time the Company may act on behalf of the Client with parties with whom the Company or any of its related parties have an agreement to receive goods or services. The Company guarantees that these agreements are made as far as possible for the benefit of the Client, for example, these agreements make it possible to access information and other services that would otherwise be inaccessible</p>
            <p>10.11. If a court of proper jurisdiction declares any provision of the Agreement (or any part of any provision) void, that provision will be treated as a separate part of the Agreement and this will not affect the legal force of the rest of the Agreement./p&gt;
